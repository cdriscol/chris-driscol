Welcome to **Wear Shorts to Work**, a blog about ideas that don't need to be complicated.

## Why This Blog Exists

I've always found that the best ideas are the ones you can explain simply. This blog is a place for short-form thoughts on:

- **Technology** - the tools we use and why they matter
- **Remote work** - making distributed teams actually work
- **Life** - the small things that make a big difference

## The Name

Why "Wear Shorts to Work"? Because comfort matters. Because formality often gets in the way of good work. Because sometimes the best ideas come when you're not trying to impress anyone.

## What to Expect

Posts here will be short and to the point. No fluff, no filler. Just ideas worth sharing.

```typescript
const approach = {
  format: "short",
  content: "useful",
  frequency: "when there's something worth saying",
};
```

Thanks for reading. More to come.
