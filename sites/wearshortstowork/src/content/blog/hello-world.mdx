I bought this domain ten years ago. January 16, 2016. It's about time I did something with it.

## The Name

My first job out of college, I wore a suit and tie every day. Sat in a dark office writing software. The work was fine, but the culture never clicked for me.

Then I found a job in Boulder, Colorado. Kegs in the kitchen. Ping-pong tables. Standing desks. Bike racks everywhere. Shoes were optional.

It changed how I thought about work.

It wasn't really about wearing shorts (though I did wear shorts, and yes, sometimes no shoes). It was about how people treated each other. Everyone got respect regardless of what they wore. That openness created space for real connection and experimentation. It made me a better engineer and a happier person.

That's what the name means to me.

## What to Expect

I'm not much of a writer. But I thought it'd be fun to share some short posts about what's on my mind.

Don't expect long essays filled with technical jargon and sophisticated tech garbage. I'm a nerd, sure, but I also race motorcycles, spend time with my family, and mostly just want to share whatever I'm thinking about.

If you stick around, I hope you'll learn some things from me. Maybe even learn a bit about me, if you care to.

More to come.
